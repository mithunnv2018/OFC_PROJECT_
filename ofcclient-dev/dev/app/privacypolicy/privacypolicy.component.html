        <li>The Services may allow you to use the App or a third party application on your Device invite other Users and/or third parties to view your Location Data on the Services or a Linked Site. If you use such functionality of the Services, then you should use caution when determining to whom you want to make your Location Data available. If you choose to Post an invitation to view your Location Data on third party Social Media Accounts, then, depending on the privacy settings of your Social Media Accounts, it is possible that persons in addition to those to whom you intended to invite to view your Location Data could have access to such information. Accordingly, you should use caution when making such an invitation via third party Social Media Accounts and you should carefully review the privacy practices of such Social Media Accounts.</li>

    </ol>
</li>

<li>
<span>Security of Your Personal Information.</span>
We exercise care and prudence in protecting the security of Personal Data provided to us. We carefully protect your data from loss, misuse, unauthorized access or disclosure, alteration, or destruction. Specifically, we or our payment processors use the Secured Socket Layer (SSL) encryption when collecting, storing, or transferring sensitive data. Personal Data is stored in password-controlled servers with limited access. However, you have a significant role in Profile security. Someone may see or edit your Personal Data if that person gains access to your username and password, so do not share these with others. WE TAKE THESE PRECAUTIONS IN AN EFFORT TO PROTECT YOUR INFORMATION AGAINST SECURITY BREACHES. HOWEVER, THIS IS NOT A GUARANTEE THAT SUCH INFORMATION MAY NOT BE ACCESSED, DISCLOSED, ALTERED, OR DESTROYED BY BREACH OF SUCH FIREWALLS AND SECURE SERVER SOFTWARE. BY USING THE WEBSITE, YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE TO ASSUME THESE RISKS.</li>

<li><span>Your Profile.</span>
Users may review and update Personal Data by logging into their Profile. To protect your privacy and security, we will also take reasonable steps to verify your identity, such as password and username, before granting access to any Personal Data. If your Profile is terminated by you or us, we will remove your name and other Personal Data from our publicly viewable database. If you close your Profile, we have no obligation to retain your information, and may delete any or all of your Profile information without liability. However, we may retain
Content related to you if we believe it may be necessary to prevent fraud or future abuse, or for legitimate business purposes, including but not limited to Profile recovery, auditing our records, enforcing our rights and obligations under our Polices and if required by law. We may also retain and use your Content if necessary to provide Services to other Users. We disclaim any liability in relation to the deletion or retention (subject to the terms of this Policy) of Content or any obligation not to delete the Content.</li>

<li><span>Use of Cookies.</span>
We and other third parties with whom we may partner may use cookies, clear GIFs (also known as ‘web beacons’), or local shared objects (sometimes called ‘flash cookies’) to help personalize the Services. A cookie is a text file that is placed on your Device or computer by a server. Cookies cannot be used to run programs or deliver viruses to your Device or computer. Cookies are uniquely assigned to you, and can only be read by the server that issued the cookie to you. A clear GIF is typically a transparent graphic image (usually 1 pixel by 1 pixel in size) that is used in conjunction with the Services, which allows us or third parties with whom we may partner to measure the actions of Users who interact with the portion of the Services that contain the clear GIF. We and other third parties use clear GIFs to measure traffic and related browsing behavior, and to improve your experience when using the Services. We and other third parties may also use customized links or other similar technologies to track hyperlinks that you click, and associate that information with your Personal Data in order to provide you with more focused communications. You have the ability to accept or decline cookies and Clear GIFs may be unusable if you elect to reject cookies. Most web browsers and Devices automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify the settings to decline cookies if you prefer. If you choose to decline cookies, you may not be able to fully experience the interactive features of the Services.</li>

<li>
<span>Compliance with the Children’s Online Policy Protection Act.</span> Protecting the privacy young people is especially important. For that reason, we never collect or maintain Personal Data or other information through the Services from those we actually know are under thirteen (13), and no part of the Services are structured to attract anyone under thirteen (13). We expressly disclaim, and you expressly release us from, any and all liability whatsoever for any controversies, claims, suits, injuries, harm, loss, penalties, damages, arising from and/or in any way related to any misrepresentations regarding the age of any User. We reserve the right to suspend and/or terminate with or without notice the Profile of User who we believe has provided false information when registering for and/or using the Services and each User agrees to make no further use of the Services after termination and/or during suspension.</li>

<li>
<span>Linked Sites; Third Party Data.</span> 
The Services and/or third parties may provide links to Linked Sites and Third Party Data. However, we are not responsible for the privacy practices employed by Linked Sites, nor are we responsible for the information or materials Third Party Data contains. This Policy applies solely to information collected by us through the Services; thus when you use a link to go from the Services to a Linked Site, this Policy is no longer in effect. We encourage Users to read the privacy policies of Linked Sites before proceeding to use them.</li>

Examples include but are not limited to scheduling, hosting, data storage, sending postal mail and e-mail, removing repetitive information from User lists, analyzing Content, providing marketing assistance, providing search results and links (including paid ads and links), processing payments, and providing customer service. We will provide such entities with access to certain information needed to perform their functions, but will take measures to ensure that they may not use it for other purposes.</li>

<li>
<span>Changes to our Policy; Miscellaneous.</span>
